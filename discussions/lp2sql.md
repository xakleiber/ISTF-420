1. What is a _primary key constraint_? What two other constraints is it equivilent to?
 - It makes each row unique. Unique constraint and not null constraint.
2. What is a _nullability constraint_? What does it prevent? 
 - All values must be known.
3. What is a _unique constraint_? What does it prevent? 
 - Stops a column from having duplicate data.
4. What is a _foreign key constraint_? What does it allow?
 - Enforces referential integrity.
5. What is a _check constraint_? What does it allow?
 - It figures out if a row is able to be in the table or to modify it.
6. What is a _default constraint_? What does it allow?
 - The default value when a value is not specified.
7. What is _domain integrity_? This is not in your text book, but it's important.
 - All columns in a relational database must be declared. 
8. What is the difference between the _where_ and the _having_ clauses? How are they alike?
 - Where applies a filter rows. Having applies a filter to groups. They both filter the results.
9. What SQL operator has the highest precedence? What SQL operator has the lowest precedence?
 - Parenthesis has the highest. Assignment has the lowest.
10. Yes or no: In the SQL standard, is _NULL_ equal to _NULL_? Why or why not?
 - No. Null cannot equal anything because null is an unkown value.
